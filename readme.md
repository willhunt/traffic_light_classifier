# Traffic Light Image Classifier
Traffic light image classifier implemented as part of Udacity "Intro to Self Driving Cars" Nanodegree

## Getting Started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
You will need the following packages:
```
numpy
matplotlib
opencv-python
```

### Running
Code is not setup to be installed. Example implementation can be seen by running notebook **notebook_traffic_light_classifier.ipynb**.  
Likely you will need to manually set the ```module_path``` unless the notebook is in your current working directory.

### Running tests
Run file **test_classifier.py**
